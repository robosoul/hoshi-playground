/**
 * Advantages of Decorator Design Pattern
 *     - It is flexible than inheritance because inheritance adds responsibility
 *       at compile time but decorator pattern adds at run time.
 *     - We can have any number of decorators and also in any order.
 *     - It extends functionality of object without affecting any other object.
 *
 * Disadvantage of Decorator Design Pattern
 *     - The main disadvantage of decorator design pattern is code maintainability
 *       because this pattern creates lots of similar decorators which are sometimes
 *       hard to maintain and distinguish.
